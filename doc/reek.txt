INTRODUCTION                                        *reek-introduction* *reek*

Reek is a tool that examines Ruby classes, modules and methods and reports any
code smells it finds.

CONFIGURATION                                       *reek-configuration*

                                                    *g:reek_always_show*
By default, any messages are shown when a file is loaded or saved. If you want
to only show messages when you open the location list, set the following in
your vimrc file:
>
	let g:reek_always_show = 0
<

                                                    *g:reek_line_limit*
Checking large files (> 1000 lines) can take a while. To load larger files
quicker, you can limit maximum number of lines a file can have and still be
checked. Files bigger than this limit will not be checked:
>
	let g:reek_line_limit = 1000
<
With no line limit set, all files will be checked.
